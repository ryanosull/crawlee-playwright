‚òëÔ∏è Prerequisites
Before installing Strapi, the following requirements must be installed on your computer:

Node.js: Only Active LTS or Maintenance LTS versions are supported (currently v18 and v20). Odd-number releases of Node, known as "current" versions of Node.js, are not supported (e.g. v19, v21).
Your preferred Node.js package manager:
npm (v6 and above)
yarn
Python (if using a SQLite database)



- The admin panel of a local Strapi project runs at http://localhost:1337/admin. This is where you will spend most of your time creating and updating content.

- If the server is not already running, in your terminal, cd into the `/packages/strapi` folder and run npm run develop (or yarn develop) to launch it.

- yarn install
- yarn start - autoreload disabled
- yarn develop - autoreload enabled ; You should never use this command to run a Strapi application in production.
- yarn strapi help
- nvm install 20 vs. nvm use 20



‚úèÔ∏è Note
When connecting Strapi to a PostgreSQL database, the database user requires SCHEMA permissions. While the database admin has this permission by default, a new database user explicitly created for the Strapi application will not. This would result in a 500 error when trying to load the admin console.

To create a new PostgreSQL user with the SCHEMA permission, use the following steps.

 Create a new database user with a secure password
$ CREATE USER my_strapi_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'password';
# Connect to the database as the PostgreSQL admin
$ \c my_strapi_db_name admin_user
 Grant schema privileges to the user
$ GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO my_strapi_db_user;
